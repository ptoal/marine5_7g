# marine5_7g
A design for a cardboard boat by the Marine 5 Group

# Introduction
At a recent teambuilding activity, the goal was to design build a cardboard boat with limited time and materials.

The Marine 5, Model 7G is the result of that effort.

## Highlights of the 7G design
- Outer hull built from a solid sheet of 4' x 8' cardboard.
- Origami fold construction.  No cuts in exterior = no water intrusion
- Double-hull design.  The outer and inner hulls are seperated by triangular ribs and stringers, providing rigidity.
- 

## Mk II Enhancements
 - Triangular gunnels, to increase rigidity along the hull.
 - Extra ribs and stringers

 - Qty 2 - 4 x 8 Cardboard Sheets
 - Qty 1 - Roll of box tape
 - Qty 1 - Pack of Markers
