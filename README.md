# marine5_7g
A design for a cardboard boat by the Marine 5 Group

# Introduction
At a recent teambuilding activity, the goal was to design build a cardboard boat with limited time and materials.

The Marine 5, Model 7G is the result of that effort.

## Highlights of the 7G design
- Outer hull built from a solid sheet of 4' x 8' cardboard.
- Origami fold construction.  No cuts in exterior = no water intrusion
- Double-hull design.  The outer and inner hulls are seperated by triangular ribs and stringers, providing rigidity.
- 

## Mk II Enhancements
 - Triangular gunnels, to increase rigidity along the hull.
 - Extra ribs and stringers

# Required Materials
 - Qty 2 - 4 x 8 Cardboard Sheets
 - Qty 1 - Roll of box tape
 - Qty 1 - Pack of Markers

# Construction Tips


# Construction

1. Begin with a sheet of 4 x 8 Cardboard.  E Flute (1.6mm thick)
Measure and mark 11" from each long side, and the aft short-side.  Use the other 4x8 sheet as a straight edge to score a line on each fold as shown in Fig 1.
NOTE: Do not cut through! You goal is to create an indentation on the top surface that will give a sharp fold. Light pressure with a utility knife that has the blade retracted works well, as does a car key, etc.)
