# marine5_7g
A design for a cardboard boat by the Marine 5 Group

# Introduction
At a recent teambuilding activity, the goal was to design build a cardboard boat with limited time and materials.

The Marine 5, Model 7G is the result of that effort.

## Highlights of the 7G design
- Outer hull built from a solid sheet of 4' x 8' cardboard.
- Origami fold construction.  No cuts in exterior = no water intrusion
- Double-hull design.  The outer and inner hulls are seperated by triangular ribs and stringers, providing rigidity.
- Triangular Ribs, Stringers and Struts

## Mk II Enhancements
 - Triangular gunnels, to increase rigidity along the hull.
 - Extra ribs and stringers

# Required Materials
 - Qty 2 - 4 x 8 Cardboard Sheets
 - Qty 1 - Roll of box tape
 - Qty 1 - Pack of Markers

# Construction Tips

## General 
The boat is a structure that is very sturdy when the whole system is 
working well.  When a weakness develops, the entire structure will fail.  
Ensure that there are no critical weak points, or your boat will fall apart
quickly.

Box tape adheres *very well to itself* and less well to everything else, 
especially wet cardboard.  Make sure there are no bubbles or wrinkles in 
the tape surfaces, especially those in contact with the water.  It has a 
great deal of tensile strength, but not much adhesive strength.  Wherever 
possible, you want the forces acting on the tape to be trying to stretch 
the tape, rather than trying to lift it.

A good tip for using the tape along long seams is to use three layers.
One strip along each side of the seam, and then one to join the two seams.
This creates a stronger bond.

## Displacement and Stability

A large flat bottom is more stable than a narrow, or wedge-shaped one.
The boat displaces the same amount of water that the boat and passenger weigh.
If the hull of the boat is flat, you can calculate how deep the boat will
sink into the water by finding the area of the bottom, and dividing by the
volume. 

Example:

Assuming the boat and it's passenger weigh 100kg, they will displace 100kg of water.
1L of water = 1kg, therefore the boat will displace 100L (100000 cm^3) of water.
If the surface area of the bottom of the boat is 
100cm x 150cm = 15000cm^2 
the boat will sink:
100000 / 15000 = 6.6cm (about 2.6", for our American readers)



# Construction

1. Begin with a sheet of 4 x 8 Cardboard.  E Flute (1.6mm thick)
Measure and mark 11" from each long side, and the aft short-side.  Use the other 4x8 sheet as a straight edge to score a line on each fold as shown in Fig 1.
NOTE: Do not cut through! You goal is to create an indentation on the top surface that will give a sharp fold. Light pressure with a utility knife that has the blade retracted works well, as does a car key, etc.)
